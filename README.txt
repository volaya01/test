Hi
To install TITOAnimals on your computer you must have a server installed as XAMPP and follow the steps below:
1. Download the .ZIP file from this repository
2. Unzip the file and locate it in the htdocs folder (this folder is found within the XAMPP location)
3. Start the Apache in the XAMPP controller
4. In your browser type localhost/test
5. On the main page we find the menu and the content of TITOAnimals, in the menu you can see the API animals and the form to create and load a new animal.

I could not send the form data to the API by the POST method, so its content is only interface
